# Mini Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small web development projects I've built to learn and showcase different programming concepts and technologies. Each project focuses on specific skills and demonstrates practical applications of web development fundamentals.

## Purpose

These mini projects serve as:
- **Learning exercises** to understand new concepts and technologies
- **Portfolio pieces** demonstrating practical coding skills
- **Reference materials** for reviewing and reinforcing knowledge
- **Documentation examples** showing clear, beginner-friendly explanations

## Projects

### üå§Ô∏è [Weather App](./weather-app/)
**Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
**Key Learning**: DOM manipulation, API integration, async/await  
**Description**: A weather search application that fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for any city and get current weather conditions with dynamic icons.

### üì∞ [News App](./news-app/)
**Technology**: React, Vite, JavaScript  
**Key Learning**: React hooks, component architecture, API security  
**Description**: A React application that searches and displays news articles from around the world. Features real-time data fetching, loading states, and error handling.

### ‚úÖ [Todo List App](./todo-list-app/)
**Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
**Key Learning**: DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage  
**Description**: A simple task management application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. Data persists locally using browser storage.

## Learning Journey

This repository represents my progression through web development concepts:

1. **Foundation** - DOM manipulation and vanilla JavaScript
2. **APIs & Async** - Working with external data and asynchronous programming
3. **Modern Frameworks** - React, component-based architecture, and state management
4. **Data Persistence** - Client-side storage and data management

## Documentation Style

Each project includes comprehensive documentation that:
- Explains concepts at a beginner-friendly level
- Provides code examples with detailed explanations
- Lists methods and functions used
- Includes recommendations for improvement
- Maintains security best practices (no exposed secrets)

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains:
- Complete source code
- Detailed markdown documentation
- Instructions for running locally
- Learning outcomes and key concepts
